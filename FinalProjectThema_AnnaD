Final project topic (proposition): Beauty salon website.
Student: Anna Danielkiewicz

Beauty salon website.
It will be the site of a real make-up artist who has FB and a blog but no website. 
The logo will be used - thus the choice of page colors, a large number of professional photos and videos.

Links to the existing page on Facebook and the blog will be created.

Bookmarks: about us, offered beauty treatments, Q&A, gallery of performed works, certificates, contact.

I will focus here especially on the graphic page, but also on the page dynamics - that is, 
that the page would not be so static, but that the photos would move, transitions below, etc.
I would like to include the most frequently asked questions and answers in Q&A. 
If the customer does not find an answer, they can fill out the contact form, 
the content of which will be sent to the email of the owner of the page.
Contact + location in relation to the point on the map and google maps.

Ideas:
- Schedule - a hard matter, I haven't come up with a solution yet and I don't know if I can adapt it to my needs.
- Comments from Facebook attached to the page.
- Phone icon - the ability to call from a phone by clicking.
- Email icon - with the option of sending an email.
- ...

Important aspects I will have to face:
- website and data security,
- privacy policy,
- proper display of the page on every device,
- appropriate attachment of photos so that they do not slow down the movement of the website,
- ...

I would like to stay with it. I was wondering what I can do, which might be useful for me at work, 
but I don't know how JS is used in large companies. That's why I focused on creating pages, 
where I can also learn a lot and can someday use my own business. 
I also count on your support, ideas and maybe introducing me to the implementation of the site.
